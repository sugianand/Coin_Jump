This is a simple called "Coin Jump" which I created using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 

First, the player clicks the start button and then begins the game. 
Next, the goal of the game is to collect as many coins as possible without falling into the lava floor at the bottom of the screen.
When you fall into the lava, you will get a "Game Over" pop up and will be given the option to play again.
The score gets recorded at the top and will only update if the player gets a higher score than the previous one. 


Feel free to download it and improve upon it! 
Hope you guys enjoy playing this game and inspires you guys to create more fun games like this!
